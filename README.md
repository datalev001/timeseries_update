Enhancing Forecast Accuracy with Incremental Adjustments Without Rebuilding Models

Understanding Incremental Learning
Imagine you run an online store with a recommendation system. Every time a customer clicks or buys something, the system updates its suggestions in real-time.
Every time a customer clicks or buys something, the recommendation system will update its suggestions in real-time. If you had to recreate the entire predictive model from beginning  every time new data came in, it would be incredibly slow and computationally expensive. That's where incremental adjustments come in.
As soon as a customer clicks on a product, the system instantly adjusts its recommendations, offering more accurate suggestions on the fly.
This approach is known as incremental learning or online learning.

Applying Incremental Learning to Time Series Forecasting
Building and applying business predictive models is a key part of my job. I enjoy working with time series analysis because it's practical and interesting. But I've learned that this work is quite challenging.
First, time changes everything. A time series forecasting model that works today might be outdated tomorrow. This makes it hard to keep up.
Second, verifying models is difficult because you can only test them with future data, meaning you won't know if they truly work until later.
Third, training data is usually valid only within a certain range, making it difficult to maintain reliable forecasts over time.
Lastly, many software tools focus much on algorithms while overlooking the critical importance of proper data handling. For instance, no tool tells me on which specific data is the best for building a time series model to predict next week's sales.
This is why I apply incremental learning in this paper - it allows continuous updates with new data, keeping forecasts accurate without rebuilding the model.
